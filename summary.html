                <p>In the article “Focus and Deep Work - Your Secret Weapons to Becoming a 10X Developer” Bar Franek 
                    talks about the importance of good focus for developers. Franek is a lead developer for a Fortune 50 company

                <p>Why is deep work and focus so important? Well, programming is a creative pursuit that really demands focus and energy.
                     When a programmer is able to stay focused for longer intentional periods, the quality and quantity of their production goes up.
                      However, the ability to focus and do deep work is not a natural gift. It is something that requires practice and it isn’t going to be easy.
                        Therefore prepare yourself and accept the fact that you’re going to struggle. </p>

                <p>There are two main steps to focus better. Firstly, remove distractions.
                     This means putting your phone away, so that notifications won’t bother you. 
                     Close e-mail and all other distracting applications and any browser windows not relevant for your task. 
                     Many developers also like to use headphones, so that outside noise won’t distract them. 
                     The second step is a time management technique called Pomodoro. The idea is that you’ll work for 25 minutes, undistracted, on one thing. 
                     Then you’ll take a 5 minute break. When you get better, you can do longer blocks of work. 
                      By applying these techniques, you’ll be able to take your productivity to the next level.</p>
